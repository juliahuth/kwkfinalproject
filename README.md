SOURCES USED IN FINAL PROJECT:

I just want to apologize for the fact that I could not add more to this project. The timing of this projects due data coincided with the week that I was moving from New Jersey to North Carolina so I had little to no time to actually work through the project to the degree that I would have hoped.

So I just want to say thanks for the opportunity regardless and I learned a lot and I hope to apply it in the future.

I used Chat GPT to help me with the CSS styling to be cohesive after I came up with the CSS color scheme since I was on a bit of a time crunch.
